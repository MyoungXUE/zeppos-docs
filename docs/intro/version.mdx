:::info
`API_LEVEL` is the version number of Zepp OS's open capabilities, introduced since Zepp OS 2.0. It defines the range of system functions that applications can use, including system interfaces, UI Widgets, etc. The higher the `API_LEVEL` version number, the richer the available features.

Each device running Zepp OS has a corresponding `API_LEVEL` version, with newer devices typically supporting higher `API_LEVEL`. The system ensures that higher version `API_LEVEL` is fully compatible with lower version applications.

For complete `API_LEVEL` and compatibility-related content, please refer to ['API_LEVEL (Compatibility)'](../guides/framework/device/compatibility.md).

To check the `API_LEVEL` version of Zepp OS devices, please refer to [Zepp OS Device List](../reference/related-resources/device-list.mdx).
