# Intro

"Workout Extension" is a new feature of Zepp OS 3.5, which extends the functionality of the "Workout" application in the form of a plug-in, aiming to enhance the user experience in sports.

This feature allows developers to use the Zepp OS JS API to create "Workout Extension" plugins, providing users with more features in "Workout" applications, including but not limited to workout data, workout charts, Compass, GoPro, and other applications.

Workout Extension has the following core values:

1. **Customizability**

- **Personalized UI design** : Developers can take advantage of the powerful widget capabilities of Zepp OS to draw and customize views with complete freedom.
- **Exclusive sports data combination** : Developers can design and choose the displayed data combination according to their personal sports type and preferences, making the interface more tailored to the needs of specific sports.
- **Instant feature expansion** : Users can add new workout features to the device without the need for over-the-air (OTA) technology.

2. **Real-time and rich sports data**

- **Real-time key indicator monitoring** : During exercise or training, users can monitor key indicators such as heart rate, speed, and distance in real-time, which helps them adjust exercise intensity and strategy in a timely manner to optimize training effectiveness.
- **In-depth high-level Data Analysis** : Provide higher-level and multi-dimensional sports data to help users deeply understand their sports performance and further improve sports skills and performance.

3. **Functional scalability**

- **Bluetooth connectivity capability** : Smartwatches can connect with external devices such as cadence sensors to obtain more comprehensive data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and depth of motion analysis.
